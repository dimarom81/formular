This is a simple Task manager application that leverages ColdBox and CF ORM.

To install:

- Create an empty database called taskmanager
- Create the datasource called "taskmanager" in the CF Admin.  Ensure it can create table permissions
- Run the app.  CF ORM *should* create the "Task" table for you on first load.



Good luck!
