This is a simple ORM application that uses the cbvalidation module

To install:

- Create an empty database called validationSample
- Create a data source called "validationSample" in the CF Admin that points to it
- Run the app.

The database tables should be created the first time it is run.  Try managing the data in the app to test the validation rules.
